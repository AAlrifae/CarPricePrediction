The project will be about car price prediction this will help us to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the Saudi Market. We want to apply some data science techniques for the price of cars with the available independent variables such as, Web scrapping, EDA, linear regression. The project will help any individual or company that lives in Saudi Arabia and nearby country to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
